# Day 26 - Stripe Follow Along Nav

Main focus of this day:
    
    1) When you enter a function (inside another function) the value of "this" is changed BUT if you use an arrow function the value of "this" is inherited
    2) Dont forget that you need to do the math yourself for the location of the nav incase of an offset

This is by far the coolest day
